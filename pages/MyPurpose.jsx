          Iâ€™m a young, determined aspiring <strong>entrepreneur in Game Development</strong>, driven by the goal of building immersive experiences that inspire and entertain. My passion isnâ€™t just about playing gamesâ€”itâ€™s about understanding what makes them great and using that knowledge to bring ideas to life.
        </p>
        <p className="w3-large">
          My background as a <strong>Fullstack Web Developer</strong> gave me hands-on experience with frontend and backend technologies that translate seamlessly into game development. Whether itâ€™s manipulating data, structuring logic, or crafting interactive components, these skills give me a strong technical edge.
        </p>
        <p className="w3-large">
          Iâ€™m confident working with the <strong>Command Line Interface</strong>, understanding how systems operate beneath the surface, and solving technical problems with precision. My experience navigating complex architecture helps me design and build with purposeâ€”and I bring that mindset into every game I plan.
        </p>
        <p className="w3-large">
          I believe coding isnâ€™t just a skillâ€”itâ€™s a bridge between imagination and reality. The tools Iâ€™ve learned in web developmentâ€”from JavaScript logic to deployment practicesâ€”fuel my ability to create games that are smart, scalable, and engaging.
        </p>
        <p className="w3-large w3-margin-top w3-center">
          <strong>Iâ€™m ready to take the next stepâ€”because this isnâ€™t just ambition. Itâ€™s preparation, determination, and passion combined.</strong>
